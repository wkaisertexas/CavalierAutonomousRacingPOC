# Cavalier Autonoymous Racing : Modular Simulation Testing

This is a proof of concept built to show one application of how a modular, representative simulation could help Cavalier Autonoymous Racing catch more defects in simulation.

## Motivation

Simulation is cheap. The cost of catching an error in simulation before a crash can literally be 4-6 orders of magnitude cheaper. 


## Data Logging

Data is logged to CSV file `experiment_data.csv` which has the following schema:

## Failure

The goal with the simulator was to create a "hello world" simulation which is a car model which follows a line. However, I was unable to get the line follower working. 

The key factor was the use of the Spline library in Unity.

```c#

```

## Future Work

This project was built as a proof of concept. However, I see expansion into two main categories:

- Sensitivity Analysis:
- University Compute Resources: Running a single on a single node can be quite slow. A custom server
